# -Classification-with-Random-Forest---2

This repository contains a project on fraud detection using Random Forest Classifier. The objective is to classify individuals as risky or good based on their taxable income and other attributes using machine learning techniques.

#Files Included :
1.raud_check_prj_10.ipynb: Final model implementation using Random Forest.
2.fraud_check_prj_10(EDA).ipynb: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and feature engineering.
3.fraud check word docx file on preocess
4 and ppt file of project 

#Key Features
1.Data preprocessing and EDA
2.Label encoding for categorical features
3.Random Forest model training and evaluation
4.Classification based on taxable income threshold
5.Feature importance analysis

# Outcome
The model helps in identifying potential fraud cases based on financial and demographic information, enabling better decision-making in risk management.
